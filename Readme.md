Rock Paper Scissors
"A challenge for someone with more knowledge than me"

INTRO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At start i try my skills in React, but i couldn't complete the task, then i try several approaches with Javascript, following different lines.
When my deadline was getting closer and by the overload of work in the  bootcamp i decided to follow first Thomas RPS Spike approach, but i couldn't complete it. The Javascript just didn't wanted to work. I try TDD but i just didn't manage to get it done.
Yesterday, i try a different approach. I follow some instructions from a coach in a video, outside school, and o followed trough, just to discover that present more problems than solutions, nonetheless i manage to make it work, with minumun requirement, i still have so much to figure out but the game is running. It was more difficult than working with legacy code, because i have to troubleshoot the app manually, because my tests didnÂ´t run. Now is 6:56 am and i honestly think i gave it all from my position to complete this "monumental task", that probably in some weeks is going to be silly and easy, because of the accelerated learning process of the bootcamp.
Thank you for the oportunity.
